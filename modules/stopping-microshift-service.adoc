= Stopping the MicroShift service

To stop the MicroShift service run:

[source,terminal]
----
sudo systemctl stop microshift
----

Note that even though the MicroShift service has been stopped, workloads deployed on MicroShift will still keep running. You can confirm this with:

[source,terminal]
----
sudo crictl ps -a
----

To also stop the deployed workloads, run:

[source,terminal]
----
sudo systemctl stop kubepods.slice
----

To configure your {op-system} machine to not start MicroShift automatically when the machine boots run:

[source,terminal]
----
sudo systemctl disable microshift
----
