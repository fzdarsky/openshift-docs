= Installing MicroShift

Perform the following steps to install MicroShift:

1. Enable the MicroShift repositories:

    sudo subscription-manager repos \
        --enable rhocp-4.12-for-rhel-8-$(uname -i)-rpms \
        --enable fast-datapath-for-rhel-8-$(uname -i)-rpms

2. Install MicroShift:

    sudo dnf install -y microshift

3. Download your installation https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[pull secret from the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console]. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the container registries that serve the container images used by MicroShift.

4. Copy that pull secret to your RHEL machine at `/etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret` and make it read/write-able by the root user only:

    sudo chown root. /etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret
    sudo chmod 600 /etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret

5. Configure at least the mandatory firewall rules (see https://xxx[firewall configuration] for more information). If your RHEL machine uses `firewalld` (the default):

    sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-source=10.42.0.0/16
    sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-source=169.254.169.1
    sudo firewall-cmd --reload

If the Volume Group (VG) that you have prepared for MicroShift has the default name `rhel`, no further configuration is necessary. If you have used a different name or if you want to change more configuration settings, please refer to https://xxx[Configuring MicroShift].
